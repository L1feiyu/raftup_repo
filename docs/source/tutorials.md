# Tutorials

RAFT-UP is currently under active development.

This page provides step-by-step tutorials demonstrating
the RAFT-UP workflow, from minimal demos to full experiments.

## Data preparation

- Notebook: [examples/demo_minimal.ipynb](https://github.com/L1feiyu/raftup_repo/blob/main/examples/demo_minimal.ipynb)
- Script: `python scripts/run_demo.py`

This demo generates a toy dataset and writes outputs to `./outputs/`.

## Fused supervised GW alignment for downsampled slices

- Notebook: [examples/demo_minimal.ipynb](https://github.com/L1feiyu/raftup_repo/blob/main/examples/demo_minimal.ipynb)
- Script: `python scripts/run_demo.py`

This demo generates a toy dataset and writes outputs to `./outputs/`.

## Supervised OT alignment for full slices through downsampled alignment

- Notebook: [examples/demo_minimal.ipynb](https://github.com/L1feiyu/raftup_repo/blob/main/examples/demo_minimal.ipynb)
- Script: `python scripts/run_demo.py`

This demo generates a toy dataset and writes outputs to `./outputs/`.

## Annoucement 

A minimal, installable dependency list and a packaged version of RAFT-UP
will be provided in a future release.
